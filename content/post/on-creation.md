I wish I had a diagram or mathematical proof to show that creative projects take time because they need layers. 

Let me explain what I mean by layers.

If you take a photograph of something, for example, that will just have one layer. 

It has meaning, sure, but it hasn't been mixed with anything imaginary or new. 

It hasn't struggled to come to be, not in a real, emotionally-taxing way... not in a way that feels like you're walking down dead ends over and over again with sweat over your brow and a tumultuous, exhausted heart, confused about if your whole endeavor is worthwhile or not...

...right before you finally find relief and arrive somewhere.

With most great creative projects, you explore and go through a maze of sorts. 

You start by knowing that the first idea you came up with has something to it. It captures something real and pure. 

But, at the same time, you understand that you don't understand what it really means yet.

You need to create other things around it in order to see its boundaries. And then you need to feel your way to its essense and taste it.

Only then will you know it.

There's always a big risk that you'll capture the right image straight from the start. If you do that, you might know it's exactly what you need without realizing *why* you need it or *how* it's meaningful.

You'll spend hours or days or even years trying to tell people about your idea, but you'll always struggle because you'll be presenting it to the wrong people in the wrong way and in the wrong contexts... like trying to sell apples to apple farmers or fresh water to dolphins. 

No one will believe what you're saying about your idea's significance because you won't understand it yourself.

Eventually, it will click that you need to sit down with it, confront it, and understand what makes it tick. 

And, the best way to do this, of course, is to try to change it, adapt it, and mold it into something different -- even though it already seems innocent and perfect and pure. 

You have to be willing to risk losing the perfect innocence of your original idea in order to see what you're really dealing with -- to understand it -- and to push it further into the place it needs to be.

About a third of the time, after going through this process, you'll end up back at the original idea, richer with the knowledge that it's actually the right idea and finally understanding *why*. 

However, about two thirds of the time, you'll need to go off into another alleyway and down a dozen dead ends in order to bring back something really meaningful. 

Doing that -- working from scratch, with no idea of where your heading -- it takes building up the your idea's layers one at a time:

Building something meaningful that has layers takes creating something, with all the effort and power you can muster, and then discarding it right after you get a taste of its essence. 

And then creating half a dozen new things after that, again putting in everything you can, tasting their essences right before dissolving them back into nothing again. 

When you've exhausted all of your ideas and you feel like you couldn't possibly birth one more idea into the world ever again because it's too confusing and painful, you'll have to take the last drop of energy you have and use it to combine everything that came before, using all their parts and pieces to make something truly brand new, alive and complete... 

And then sanding down its edges with what you've learned about how it works and incorporating all the details about it that you know it needs, after wrestling with them over months of hard work and searching effort. 

That's what creating something of real quality takes...

It's brutal, beautiful, and bold. 

It's also a nightmare. It challenges our empathy and ruins our attachment to the idea that everything has some special, indivisible essense. 

However, it's worth it.

It can open you up to an entirely new new world if you're not afraid to reach into the dark and break things that you don't understand yet. 

Only then can you turn around and pull other people through the doorway you've created, finally able to show them something they've never seen before.
