    <p>I wish I could have a diagram or mathematical proof that could succinctly show that creative projects take time because they need layers. If you take a photograph or make a photo-realistic drawing of something, that will just have one layer in my view.</p>

<p>It has meaning, sure, but it hasn&rsquo;t been mixed with anything imaginary. It hasn&rsquo;t struggled to come to be, not in any real, emotionally-taxing way&hellip; not in a way that feels like you&rsquo;re walking down dead ends over and over again with sweat over your brow and a tumultuous, exhausted heart, confused about your whole endeavor and its worthwhileness, just before you actually, finally arrive somewhere.</p>

<p>With most great creative projects, you explore and go through a maze of sorts. You know the first idea that you came up with has something to it, that it captures something real and pure, but you need to create these other things around it in order to see the boundaries around your original idea and understand what the idea really means. You need to get at its essense and taste it.</p>

<p>Because, even if you capture the right image in the first shot, if you don&rsquo;t know why and how it communicates the idea you&rsquo;re after, you&rsquo;ll struggle with it. You&rsquo;ll present it to the wrong people in the wrong ways and in the wrong contexts. No one&rsquo;s going to believe what you&rsquo;re saying about its significance because you really don&rsquo;t understand it yourself.</p>

<p>So, you need to see what makes it tick. And the best way to do that is to try to change it, adapt it, see if you can make it do something different - even though something about it already seems perfect.</p>

<p>You have to be willing to risk losing that perfect innocense in order to really figure it out and push it to where it needs to be.</p>

<p>About a third of the time, you end up back at the original idea and working from there. But, two thirds of the time, you need to go way off in another direction to really bring back something that&rsquo;s meaningful and powerful. And doing that takes building up the image&rsquo;s layers from scratch.</p>

<p>It takes creating something, with all the arduous work that takes, and tasting its soul just before you dissolve its form into putty again. And then creating yet another and another thing after that, tasting their souls, and dissolving their forms. And, when your exhausted from this process and feel like you can&rsquo;t create anything new ever again, you have to take everything you know so far and combine it all into one final creation that uses the parts and pieces from all of the ones that came before.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what creating something of real quality takes, from my perspective.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful and brutal and bold. It&rsquo;s a nightmare and it challenges our empathy and our attachment to the idea that everything has an indivisible essense. But it can also open up an entirely new new world if you&rsquo;re not afraid to reach into the dark and break things you don&rsquo;t understand yet. It can let you break through a doorway into a new reality that no on has ever travelled into before - and then reach back and pull other people through with you.</p>
