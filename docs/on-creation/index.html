    <p>I wish I had a diagram or mathematical proof to show that creative projects take time because they need layers.</p>

<p>Let me explain what I mean by layers.</p>

<p>If you take a photograph or make a photo-realistic drawing of something, for example, that will just have one layer.</p>

<p>It has meaning, sure, but it hasn&rsquo;t been mixed with anything imaginary or new.</p>

<p>It hasn&rsquo;t struggled to come to be, not in a real, emotionally-taxing way&hellip; not in a way that feels like you&rsquo;re walking down dead ends over and over again with sweat over your brow and a tumultuous, exhausted heart, confused about if your whole endeavor is worthwhile or not&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;right before you find relief and finally arrive somewhere.</p>

<p>With most great creative projects, you explore and go through a maze of sorts.</p>

<p>You start by knowing that the first idea you came up with has something to it. It captures something real and pure.</p>

<p>But, at the same time, you understand that you don&rsquo;t understand what it really means yet.</p>

<p>You need to create other things around it in order to see its boundaries. And then you need to feel your way to its essense and taste it.</p>

<p>Only then will you really know it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s always a big risk that you&rsquo;ll capture the right image straight from the start. If you do that, you might realize it&rsquo;s just what you need without realizing that you don&rsquo;t know <em>why</em> you need it or how it&rsquo;s meaningful.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll spend hours trying to communicate your idea to people, struggling because you&rsquo;re presenting it to the wrong people in the wrong ways and in the wrong contexts, like trying to sell apples to apple farmers.</p>

<p>No one will believe what you&rsquo;re saying about your idea&rsquo;s significance because you don&rsquo;t understand it yourself.</p>

<p>Eventually, you realize you need to sit down with it and understand what makes it tick. And, the best way to do this, is to try to change it, adapt it, mold it into something different &ndash; even though something about it already seems innocent and perfect.</p>

<p>You have to be willing to risk losing this perfect innocense in order to figure it out, understand it, and push your idea beyond where it is to where it needs to be.</p>

<p>About a third of the time, after going through this process, you&rsquo;ll end up back at the original idea, richer with the knowledge that this is where you need to be.</p>

<p>However, about two thirds of the time, you&rsquo;ll need to go way off into another alleyway and down a dozen dead ends in order to bring back something really meaningful.</p>

<p>Doing that &ndash; working from scratch &ndash; it takes building up the your idea&rsquo;s layers one at a time:</p>

<p>Building something meaningful that has layers takes creating something, with all the effort and power you can muster, and then discarding it right after you get a taste of its soul.</p>

<p>And then creating half a dozen new things after that, again putting in everything you can, and then tasting their souls right before dissolving them back into putty again.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;ve exhausted all your ideas and you feel like you couldn&rsquo;t possibly birth one more idea into the world ever again, you have to take your last drop of energy and use it to combine all the parts and pieces from everything that came before in order to make something truly brand new, sanding its edges down with what you&rsquo;ve learned about how it works and incorporating all you&rsquo;ve wrestled with.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what creating something of real quality takes&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful, and brutal, and bold.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nightmare and it challenges our empathy and our attachment to the idea that everything has an indivisible essense.</p>

<p>But, it can also open up an entirely new new world if you&rsquo;re not afraid to reach into the dark and break things that you don&rsquo;t understand yet.</p>

<p>Creating something truly new can let you break through a doorway that no on has ever travelled through before - and let you reach back and pull other people through to the other side with you.</p>
